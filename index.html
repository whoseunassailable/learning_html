      <h3>1. What Are Dolphins?</h3>
      <p>
        Dolphins are marine mammals that belong to the cetacean group, which
        also includes whales and porpoises.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Species Count:</h3>
      They are known for their intelligence, playfulness, and strong social
      bonds.
      <br />

      <h3>3. Where Do They Live?</h3>
      Most dolphins live in saltwater oceans, but some species, like the Amazon
      river dolphin, thrive in freshwater rivers.

      <h3>4. Intelligence and Behavior:</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dolphins have large brains and show complex behaviors
        such as
        <em><strong>problem-solving</strong></em
        >, tool use, and even <em><strong>self-recognition</strong></em> in
        mirrors.

      language.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Known for their playful nature, they often surf
        waves, interact with humans, and play games with each other. Also
